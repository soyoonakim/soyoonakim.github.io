Resources for a beginning birder

Merlin App 
Identifies a bird by its sound + Bird Dictionary on your phone. 
It is a very useful app for a beginner because it is easier to hear birds than to see. It also helps to identify the bird by its appearance and habitat. Concisely provides important bird information.   

eBird App 
Record the birds you observed. This data helps Cornell Ornithology Lab to monitor birds. You can also see on the map where is the birding hotspot around the area. If you'd like to see a certain species of bird, you can find out where it has appeared recently. 

Macaulay Library
This online media bird archive run by Cornell Ornithology Lab has materials since 1929. Thousands of images, audio files, and footage are updated daily from around the world. 
https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/

Cornell Ornithology Lab 
Their All About Birds page has so many interesting articles and courses where you can gain professional knowledge about birds. Understanding Bird Behavior, How to record Bird Sounds, to name a few.   

National Audubon Society 
If you want to meet local fellow birders, attend one of your Audubon local chapter events. You will meet people who devote their weekends to birding(just like me). 
www.audubon.org

Wild Birds Unlimited
This is a Nationwide chain store for birders. They have everything - seeds for your birdfeeder, birdbaths, cute postcards with birds, caps with birds, cups with birds, everything you can imagine with birds, and even binoculars to watch birds. Highly recommend to stop by if you have a store near you. 
 
Wingspan board game
If you love birds, you must have this board game! It has several hundreds of bird cards; each painted beautifully. You will grow these birds in their appropriate habitats, feed them with their favorite food, lay eggs, and learn their special powers.
