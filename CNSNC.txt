CNSNC

CNSNC (consonances in the word "Consonance") is a Baltimore-based collective of five composers (Zach Gulaboff Davis, Daniel Despins, Bobby Ge, Gu Wei, and Seo Yoon Soyoona Kim) that was founded in 2019 with the goal of presenting and promoting contemporary music to new audiences in the Baltimore area and beyond.

​

Consonance’s mission is to connect with a new generation of listeners through interactive concerts and multimedia collaborations. We partner with innovative musicians and nontraditional venues, prizing musicality and communicability in our work.  We eschew restrictive formalities and seek to engage communities in conversation, especially those not traditionally served. 

​

We believe that classical music is alive. It was not meant to be enshrined as a museum artifact, nor caged in ivory towers, nor used as a measure of learnedness. Our shared hope is that by the end of each program, at least one audience member has the realization that they, too, can be a composer.
