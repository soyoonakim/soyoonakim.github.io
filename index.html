<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>This is Seo Yoon Soyoona Kim. <br>
I am a composer in the United States.<br>
I'm moving my website to GitHub because Wix.com is too expensive. <br>
Recently, it quadrupled the price, requiring me to pay $870 to maintain the website for the next three years.<br> <br>
From now on, my composer's site will be hosted on GitHub Pages, and it will be completely free. 
</p>

<p>To-do list:<br><br>

<ol>
<li> Move all the information from my current Wix webpage <br>
Visit <a href="https://www.soyoonakim.com"> my current Wix webpage</a> </li>
<li> Ensure everything works correctly </li>
<li> Make it beautiful and eye-pleasing </li>
<li> Publish the new website by June 21, 2024 </li>
<li> Show off on Instagram @soyoonakimcomposer </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Bye until then. <br>
